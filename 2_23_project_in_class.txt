What research question do you want to answer?
Does the concussion that Antonio Brown received from his hit by Burfict change his behavior?

What are two possible answers?
2 possible answers include yes, his behavior did change after getting the concussion or no, it didn't change.

What are the documents of text data you will analyze?
I plan to use his tweets from before that concussion and after.



Give two examples of documents in the corpus that you expect will be high in similarity to each other? Two examples that are *low* in similarity?
I expect that his documents that are only one word or 2 words in length and tweets that use the same type of words/sayings like "Business is booming", will have high similarity. I expect that documents that are one word in length compared with documents that have a lot of words will have low similarity. Also, I expect the documents from around the time when he was suspeneded from the NFL/let go from his teams for his behavior to use very different language than he did before that time.
